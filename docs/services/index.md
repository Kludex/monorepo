# Services

I'm also available for **consultancy** and **training** services.

!!! danger
    I'm only available **outside** European working hours.

    I'm currently working full-time at [**Pydantic**](https://pydantic.dev/).
    Which reminds me... Have you heard about [**Logfire**](https://pydantic.dev/logfire)? ðŸš€

I'm an experienced software engineer, with a focus on **Python**, **FastAPI**, and related technologies.

I think my work says more about me than I could ever write here: **check my [GitHub] and [LinkedIn] profiles.**

My services include:

- **Review and audit** of your codebase, architecture, and infrastructure.
- **Consultancy** on software architecture, design, and implementation.
- **Development** of new features, APIs, and applications.
- **Performance optimization** of your applications and infrastructure.
- **Training** for your team on Python, FastAPI, and related technologies.
- **Workshops** on Python, FastAPI, and related technologies.

If I can help you or your team with any of these services, **[contact me](mailto:marcelotryle@gmail.com)**.
