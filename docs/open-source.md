# Open Source

I maintain, and help on a lot of open source projects. Mainly on the web python ecosystem.

For time to time people ask me how can they can start contributing, but most of them are not sure where to start.
And to be honest, most of them just ask me, and don't follow any advice I give them.

I've created this page to help you to start contributing to open source projects.

## Do you want to help?

Here's a list of issues that you can start with:

- Local dev server - [Kludex/mangum#123](https://github.com/Kludex/mangum/issues/123)
- Enable `branch = true` for `coverage.run` - [encode/starlette#2452](https://github.com/encode/starlette/issues/2452)
